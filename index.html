                Cosmetics are constituted mixtures of chemical compounds derived from either natural sources, or synthetically created ones.<br>
                [1] Cosmetics have various purposes. Those designed for personal care and skin care can be used to cleanse or protect the body or skin. <br>
                Cosmetics designed to enhance or alter one's appearance (makeup) can be used to conceal blemishes, enhance one's natural features <br>
                (such as the eyebrows and eyelashes), add color to a person's face, or change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a<br>
                 different person, creature or object.[2] Cosmetics can also be designed to add fragrance to the body.</p>
            <h2>Use</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
                Cosmetics designed for skin care can be used to cleanse, exfoliate and protect the skin, as well as replenishing it, by the use of <br>
                cleansers, toners, serums, moisturizers, eye creams, retinal, and balms. Cosmetics designed for more general personal care, such as shampoo,<br>
                 soap, and body wash, can be used to cleanse the body.</p>

            <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                Primers are used on the face before makeup is applied, creating a typically transparent, smooth layer over the<br> 
                top of the skin,allowing for makeup to be applied smoothly and evenly. Some primers may also be tinted, and this tint <br>
                may match the wearer's skin tone,or may colour correct it, using greens, oranges and purples to even out the wearer's skin <br>
                tone and correct redness, purple shadows or orange discolouration respectively.<br>
